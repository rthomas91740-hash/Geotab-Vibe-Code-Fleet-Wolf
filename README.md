# Geotab HOS Predictive Dispatch AI

An AI-powered dispatch assistant that forecasts HOS violations 
and recommends optimal driver assignments using real fleet data.

## Competition
Geotab Vibe Coding Competition 2026

## Problem
Dispatchers currently assign drivers reactively. 
They check HOS manually and often discover violations too late.

## Solution
This project uses Geotab API data and Google Gemini reasoning 
to predict HOS risk and recommend the safest, most compliant driver 
before violations happen.

## Vision
Move from reactive dispatch to predictive fleet intelligence.

## Status
Infrastructure setup complete. Development beginning soon.
